##R
Use this document to run examples from "The Book of R" so that I can do more intentional R learning. 
30 minutes per gardens day.


Customize the prompt?
you can replace the prompt in the console ">" with anything
The Book of R likes to change it to ">R "
I might like project-specific or encouraging ones.
```{r}
options(prompt="R> ")
options(prompt = "Hooray!")
#I think I like vanilla for now, but I like the idea of positivity and customization! could be useful when using multiple code platforms & taking notes.
options(prompt="> ")
```
